# CPSC484-Project

I had originally wanted to use the QT Ray Tracer for my project, however I ran into many difficulties getting it to work. 
Because of these problems I decided to switch to using Unity. I used Unity version 2020.1.3f1 using Unity's High Definition 
Render Pipeline (HDRP) and a Windows 10 machine.

To install using Unity Hub
  - Open Unity Hub
  - Under Installs, Install Unity version 2020.1.3f1
  - Under Projects, Click add and select the folder containing the projects
  - Open the project (this may take some time)
  
The High Dynamic Range Image (HDRI) used for the skybox was taken from www.hdrihaven.com and is licensed as CC0

All other textures were obtained from www.pexels.com and are 100% free to use.
